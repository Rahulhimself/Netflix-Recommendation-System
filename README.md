# Netflix-Recommendation-System
Netflix Recommendation System

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that builds and analyzes a movie recommendation system based on the Netflix dataset. It includes data analysis, visualization, and the implementation of a recommendation algorithm to suggest movies to users.

Project Description:
The primary goal of this project is to create a functional movie recommendation system. The notebook performs an in-depth analysis of the dataset, identifies trends in user ratings and movie metadata, and visualizes key insights. The core of the project is the implementation of a recommendation algorithm that provides personalized movie suggestions to users, aiming to enhance their viewing experience.

Features:
Data Analysis: Uses the Pandas and NumPy libraries to clean and analyze the dataset, including handling missing values and exploring user-movie interactions.

Data Visualization: Leverages Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize trends in movie ratings, user behavior, and other key insights from the dataset.

Recommendation System: Implements a recommendation algorithm to suggest movies to users based on their viewing history and preferences.

Model Evaluation: Evaluates the performance of the recommendation system to ensure the quality of the recommendations.
